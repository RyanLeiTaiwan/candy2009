 ** Description: The car-training program based on the paper:
    Fast Human Detection Using a Novel Boosted Cascading Structure With Meta Stages, Chen and Chen, 2008.
	Important techniques / concepts:
	1. Real AdaBoost -> For now, use basic binary Adaboost
	2. Cascaded classifiers -> For now, it is without meta stages (no confidence values)
	3. Rectangle / Edge Orientation Histogram / Edge-Density features
	4. Integral image / Integral histogram
